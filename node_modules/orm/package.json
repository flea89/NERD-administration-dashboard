  "readme": "## Object Relational Mapping\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dresende/node-orm2.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dresende/node-orm2)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install orm\n```\n\nCurrent stable version: **2.0.6**\n\n## DBMS Support\n\n- MySQL\n- PostgreSQL\n- Amazon Redshift\n- SQLite\n\n## Features\n\n- Create Models, sync, drop, bulk create, get, find, remove, count\n- Create Model associations, find, check, create and remove\n- Define custom validations (several builtin validations, check instance properties before saving)\n- Model instance caching and integrity (table rows fetched twice are the same object, changes to one change all)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a node.js object relational mapping module.\n\nAn example:\n\n```js\nvar orm = require(\"orm\");\n\norm.connect(\"mysql://username:password@host/database\", function (err, db) {\n\tif (err) throw err;\n\n\tvar Person = db.define(\"person\", {\n\t\tname      : String,\n\t\tsurname   : String,\n\t\tage       : Number,\n\t\tmale      : Boolean,\n\t\tcontinent : [ \"Europe\", \"America\", \"Asia\", \"Africa\", \"Australia\", \"Antartica\" ], // ENUM type\n\t\tphoto     : Buffer, // BLOB/BINARY\n\t\tdata      : Object // JSON encoded\n\t}, {\n\t\tmethods: {\n\t\t\tfullName: function () {\n\t\t\t\treturn this.name + ' ' + this.surname;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\tvalidations: {\n\t\t\tage: orm.validators.rangeNumber(18, undefined, \"under-age\")\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\n\tPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }, function (err, people) {\n\t\t// SQL: \"SELECT * FROM person WHERE surname = 'Doe'\"\n\n\t\tconsole.log(\"People found: %d\", people.length);\n\t\tconsole.log(\"First person: %s, age %d\", people[0].fullName(), people[0].age);\n\n\t\tpeople[0].age = 16;\n\t\tpeople[0].save(function (err) {\n\t\t\t// err.msg = \"under-age\";\n\t\t});\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n## Express\n\nIf you're using Express, you might want to use the simple middleware to integrate more easily.\n\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar orm = require('orm');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.use(orm.express(\"mysql://username:password@host/database\", {\n\tdefine: function (db, models) {\n\t\tmodels.person = db.define(\"person\", { ... });\n\t}\n}));\napp.listen(80);\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n\t// req.models is a reference to models used above in define()\n\treq.models.person.find(...);\n});\n```\n\nYou can call `orm.express` more than once to have multiple database connections. Models defined across connections\nwill be joined together in `req.models`. **Don't forget to use it before `app.use(app.router)`, preferably right after your\nassets public folder(s).**\n\n## Settings\n\nSettings are used to store key value pairs. A settings object is stored on the global orm object and on each database connection.\n\n```js\nvar orm = require(\"orm\");\n\norm.settings.set(\"some.deep.value\", 123);\n\norm.connect(\"....\", function (err, db) {\n    // db.settings is a snapshot of the settings at the moment\n    // of orm.connect(). changes to it don't affect orm.settings\n\n\tconsole.log(db.settings.get(\"some.deep.value\")); // 123\n\tconsole.log(db.settings.get(\"some.deep\"));       // { value: 123 }\n});\n```\n\n## Models\n\nA Model is an abstraction over one or more database tables. Models support associations (more below). The name of the model is assumed to match the table name.\n\nModels support behaviours for accessing and manipulating table data.\n\n## Defining Models\n\nCall `define` on the database connection to setup a model. The name of the table and model is used as an identifier for the model on the database connection, so you can easily access the model later using the connection.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {        // 'person' will be the table in the database as well as the model id\n\t// properties\n\tname    : String,                     // you can use native objects to define the property type\n\tsurname : { type: \"text\", size: 50 }  // or you can be specific and define aditional options\n}, {\n\t// options (optional)\n});\n```\n\n## Loading Models\n\nModels can be in separate modules. Simply ensure that the module holding the models uses module.exports to publish a function that accepts the database connection, then load your models however you like.\n\nNote - using this technique you can have cascading loads.\n\n```js\n// your main file (after connecting)\ndb.load(\"./models\", function (err) {\n    // loaded!\n    var Person = db.models.person;\n    var Pet    = db.models.pet;\n});\n\n// models.js\nmodule.exports = function (db, cb) {\n    db.load(\"./models-extra\", function (err) {\n        if (err) {\n            return cb(err);\n        }\n\n        db.define('person', {\n            name : String\n        });\n\n        return cb();\n    });\n};\n\n// models-extra.js\nmodule.exports = function (db, cb) {\n    db.define('pet', {\n        name : String\n    });\n\n    return cb();\n};\n```\n\n## Synchronizing Models\n\nModels can create their underlying tables in the database. You may call Model.sync() on each Model to create the underlying table or you can call db.sync() at a connection level to create all tables for all models.\n\n```js\n// db.sync() can also be used\nPerson.sync(function (err) {\n\t!err && console.log(\"done!\");\n});\n```\n\n## Dropping Models\n\nIf you want to drop a Model and remove all tables you can use the `.drop()` method.\n\n```js\nPerson.drop(function (err) {\n\t!err && console.log(\"person model no longer exists!\");\n});\n```\n\n## Advanced Options\n\nORM2 allows you some advanced tweaks on your Model definitions. You can configure these via settings or in the call to `define` when you setup the Model.\n\nFor example, each Model instance has a unique ID in the database. This table column is\nby default \"id\" but you can change it.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define(\"person\", {\n\tname : String\n}, {\n\tid   : \"person_id\"\n});\n\n// or just do it globally..\ndb.settings.set(\"properties.primary_key\", \"UID\");\n\n// ..and then define your Models\nvar Pet = db.define(\"pet\", {\n\tname : String\n});\n```\n\n**Pet** model will have 2 columns, an `UID` and a `name`.\n\nOther options:\n\n- `cache` : (default: `true`) Set it to `false` to disable Instance cache ([Singletons](#singleton)) or set a timeout value (in seconds);\n- `autoSave` : (default: `false`) Set it to `true` to save an Instance right after changing any property;\n- `autoFetch` : (default: `false`) Set it to `true` to fetch associations when fetching an instance from the database;\n- `autoFetchLimit` : (default: `1`) If `autoFetch` is enabled this defines how many hoops (associations of associations)\n  you want it to automatically fetch.\n\n## Hooks\n\nIf you want to listen for a type of event than occurs in instances of a Model, you can attach a function that\nwill be called when that event happens.\n\nCurrently the following events are supported:\n\n- `afterLoad` : (no parameters) Right after loading and preparing an instance to be used;\n- `beforeSave` : (no parameters) Right before trying to save;\n- `afterSave` : (bool success) Right after saving;\n- `beforeCreate` : (no parameters) Right before trying to save a new instance;\n- `afterCreate` : (bool success) Right after saving a new instance;\n- `beforeRemove` : (no parameters) Right before trying to remove an instance.\n- `afterRemove` : (bool success) Right after removing an instance;\n\nAll hook function are called with `this` as the instance so you can access anything you want related to it.\n\n## Finding Items\n\n### Model.get(id, [ options ], cb)\n\nTo get a specific element from the database use `Model.get`.\n\n```js\nPerson.get(123, function (err, person) {\n\t// finds person with id = 123\n});\n```\n\n### Model.find([ conditions ] [, options ] [, limit ] [, order ] [, cb ])\n\nFinding one or more elements has more options, each one can be given in no specific parameter order. Only `options` has to be after `conditions` (even if it's an empty object).\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ name: \"John\", surname: \"Doe\" }, 3, function (err, people) {\n\t// finds people with name='John' AND surname='Doe' and returns the first 3\n});\n```\n\nIf you need to sort the results because you're limiting or just because you want them sorted do:\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }, \"name\", function (err, people) {\n\t// finds people with surname='Doe' and returns sorted by name ascending\n});\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }, [ \"name\", \"Z\" ], function (err, people) {\n\t// finds people with surname='Doe' and returns sorted by name descending\n\t// ('Z' means DESC; 'A' means ASC - default)\n});\n```\n\nThere are more options that you can pass to find something. These options are passed in a second object:\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }, { offset: 2 }, function (err, people) {\n\t// finds people with surname='Doe', skips the first 2 and returns the others\n});\n```\n\n### Model.count([ conditions, ] cb)\n\nIf you just want to count the number of items that match a condition you can just use `.count()` instead of finding all\nof them and counting. This will actually tell the database server to do a count (it won't be done in the node process itself).\n\n```js\nPerson.count({ surname: \"Doe\" }, function (err, count) {\n\tconsole.log(\"We have %d Does in our db\", count);\n});\n```\n\n### Model.exists([ conditions, ] cb)\n\nSimilar to `.count()`, this method just checks if the count is greater than zero or not.\n\n```js\nPerson.exists({ surname: \"Doe\" }, function (err, exists) {\n\tconsole.log(\"We %s Does in our db\", exists ? \"have\" : \"don't have\");\n});\n```\n\n### Aggregating Functions\n\nIf you need to get some aggregated values from a Model, you can use `Model.aggregate()`. Here's an example to better\nillustrate:\n\n```js\nPerson.aggregate({ surname: \"Doe\" }).min(\"age\").max(\"age\").get(function (err, min, max) {\n\tconsole.log(\"The youngest Doe guy has %d years, while the oldest is %d\", min, max);\n});\n```\n\nPossible aggregating functions:\n\n- `min`\n- `max`\n- `avg`\n- `sum`\n- `count` (there's a shortcut to this - `Model.count`)\n\n### Available options\n\n- `offset`: discards the first `N` elements\n- `limit`: although it can be passed as a direct argument, you can use it here if you prefer\n- `only`: if you don't want all properties, you can give an array with the list of properties you want\n\n#### Chaining\n\nIf you prefer less complicated syntax you can chain `.find()` by not giving a callback parameter.\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }).limit(3).offset(2).only(\"name\", \"surname\").run(function (err, people) {\n    // finds people with surname='Doe', skips first 2 and limits to 3 elements,\n    // returning only 'name' and 'surname' properties\n});\n```\n\nYou can also chain and just get the count in the end. In this case, offset, limit and order are ignored.\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }).count(function (err, people) {\n    // people = number of people with surname=\"Doe\"\n});\n```\n\nAlso available is the option to remove the selected items.\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }).remove(function (err) {\n    // Does gone..\n});\n```\n\nYou can also make modifications to your instances using common Array traversal methods and save everything\nin the end.\n\n```js\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }).each(function (person) {\n\tperson.surname = \"Dean\";\n}).save(function (err) {\n\t// done!\n});\n\nPerson.find({ surname: \"Doe\" }).each().filter(function (person) {\n\treturn person.age >= 18;\n}).sort(function (person1, person2) {\n\treturn person1.age < person2.age;\n}).get(function (people) {\n\t// get all people with at least 18 years, sorted by age\n});\n```\n\nOf course you could do this directly on `.find()`, but for some more complicated tasks this can be very usefull.\n\n`Model.find()` does not return an Array so you can't just chain directly. To start chaining you have to call\n`.each()` (with an optional callback if you want to traverse the list). You can then use the common functions\n`.filter()`, `.sort()` and `.forEach()` more than once.\n\nIn the end (or during the process..) you can call:\n- `.count()` if you just want to know how many items there are;\n- `.get()` to retrieve the list;\n- `.save()` to save all item changes.\n\n#### Conditions\n\nConditions are defined as an object where every key is a property (table column). All keys are supposed\nto be concatenated by the logical `AND`. Values are considered to match exactly, unless you're passing\nan `Array`. In this case it is considered a list to compare the property with.\n\n```js\n{ col1: 123, col2: \"foo\" } // `col1` = 123 AND `col2` = 'foo'\n{ col1: [ 1, 3, 5 ] } // `col1` IN (1, 3, 5)\n```\n\nIf you need other comparisons, you have to use a special object created by some helper functions. Here are\na few examples to describe it:\n\n```js\n{ col1: orm.eq(123) } // `col1` = 123 (default)\n{ col1: orm.ne(123) } // `col1` <> 123\n{ col1: orm.gt(123) } // `col1` > 123\n{ col1: orm.gte(123) } // `col1` >= 123\n{ col1: orm.lt(123) } // `col1` < 123\n{ col1: orm.lte(123) } // `col1` <= 123\n{ col1: orm.between(123, 456) } // `col1` BETWEEN 123 AND 456\n```\n\n### Caching & Integrity\n\nModel instances are cached. If multiple different queries will result in the same result, you will\nget the same object. If you have other systems that can change your database (or you're developing and need\nto make some manual changes) you should remove this feature by disabling cache. This can be done when you're\ndefining the Model.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname    : String\n}, {\n\tcache   : false\n});\n```\n\nThe cache can be configured to expire after a period of time by passing in a number instead of a\nboolean. The number will be considered the cache timeout in seconds (you can use floating point).\n\n**Note**: One exception about Caching is that it won't be used if an instance is not saved. For example, if\nyou fetch a Person and then change it, while it doesn't get saved it won't be passed from Cache.\n\n## Creating Items\n\n### Model.create(items, cb)\n\nTo insert new elements to the database use `Model.create`.\n\n```js\nPerson.create([\n\t{\n\t\tname: \"John\",\n\t\tsurname: \"Doe\",\n\t\tage: 25,\n\t\tmale: true\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tname: \"Liza\",\n\t\tsurname: \"Kollan\",\n\t\tage: 19,\n\t\tmale: false\n\t}\n], function (err, items) {\n\t// err - description of the error or null\n\t// items - array of inserted items\n});\n```\n\n## Associations\n\nAn association is a relation between one or more tables.\n\n## hasOne vs. hasMany\n\nSince this topic brings some confusion to many people including myself, here's a list of the possibilities\nsupported by both types of association.\n\n- `hasOne` : it's a **Many-to-One** relationship. A.hasOne(B) means A will have one (or none) of B, but B can be\n  associated with many A;\n- `hasMany`: it's a **One-to-Many** relationship. A.hasMany(B) means A will have none, one or more of B. Actually\n  B will be associated with possibly many A but you don't have how to find it easily (see next);\n- `hasMany` + reverse: it's a **Many-to-Many** relationship. A.hasMany(B, { reverse: A }) means A can have none or\n  many B and also B can have none or many A. Accessors will be created in both models so you can manage them from\n  both sides.\n\nIf you have a relation of 1 to 0 or 1 to 1, you should use `hasOne` association. This assumes a column in the model that has the id of the other end of the relation.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nvar Animal = db.define('animal', {\n\tname : String\n});\nAnimal.hasOne(\"owner\", Person); // assumes column 'owner_id' in 'animal' table\n\n// get animal with id = 123\nAnimal.get(123, function (err, Foo) {\n\t// Foo is the animal model instance, if found\n\tFoo.getOwner(function (err, John) {\n\t\t// if Foo animal has really an owner, John points to it\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nYou can mark the `owner_id` field as required in the database by specifying the `required` option:\n```js\nAnimal.hasOne(\"owner\", Person, { required: true });\n```\n\nIf you prefer to use another name for the field (owner_id) you can change this parameter in the settings.\n\n```js\ndb.settings.set(\"properties.association_key\", \"id_{name}\"); // {name} will be replaced by 'owner' in this case\n```\n\n**Note: This has to be done prior to the association creation.**\n\nFor relations of 1 to many you have to use `hasMany` associations. This assumes the existence of a separate join table that has 2 columns, each referencing the table in the association. Ideally, these would be foreign key relationships in your database.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nPerson.hasMany(\"friends\"); // omitting the other Model, it will assume self model\n\nPerson.get(123, function (err, John) {\n\tJohn.getFriends(function (err, friends) {\n\t\t// assumes table person_friends with columns person_id and friends_id\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nThe `hasMany` associations can have additional properties that are assumed to be in the association table.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nPerson.hasMany(\"friends\", {\n    rate : Number\n});\n\nPerson.get(123, function (err, John) {\n\tJohn.getFriends(function (err, friends) {\n\t\t// assumes rate is another column on table person_friends\n\t\t// you can access it by going to friends[N].extra.rate\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nIf you prefer you can activate `autoFetch`. This way associations are automatically fetched when you get or find instances of a model.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nPerson.hasMany(\"friends\", {\n    rate : Number\n}, {\n    autoFetch : true\n});\n\nPerson.get(123, function (err, John) {\n    // no need to do John.getFriends() , John already has John.friends Array\n});\n```\n\nYou can also define this option globally instead of a per association basis.\n\n```js\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n}, {\n    autoFetch : true\n});\nPerson.hasMany(\"friends\", {\n    rate : Number\n});\n```\n\nAssociations can make calls to the associated Model by using the `reverse` option. For example, if you have an\nassociation from ModelA to ModelB, you can create an accessor in ModelB to get instances from ModelA.\nConfusing? Look at the next example.\n\n```js\nvar Pet = db.define('pet', {\n\tname : String\n});\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nPet.hasOne(\"owner\", Person, {\n\treverse : \"pets\"\n});\n\nPerson(4).getPets(function (err, pets) {\n\t// although the association was made on Pet,\n\t// Person will have an accessor (getPets)\n\t//\n\t// In this example, ORM will fetch all pets\n\t// whose owner_id = 4\n});\n```\n\nThis makes even more sense when having `hasMany` associations since you can manage the Many-to-Many associations\nfrom both sides.\n\n\n```js\nvar Pet = db.define('pet', {\n\tname : String\n});\nvar Person = db.define('person', {\n\tname : String\n});\nPerson.hasMany(\"pets\", Pet, {\n    bought  : Date\n}, {\n\treverse : \"owners\"\n});\n\nPerson(1).getPets(...);\nPet(2).getOwners(...);\n```\n",
